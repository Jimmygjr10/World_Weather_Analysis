# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
In this project I worked with API's to communicate with the front end weather page to pull current weather for random lattitudes and longitudes I generated using the random module in Python. I also used the google cloud API for visualization to pull up the coordinates on a heat map.

## Results
The heat map included:
### City
### Country
### Weather
### Nearest Hotel
